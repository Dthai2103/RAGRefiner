Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources. This approach addresses the limitations of LLMs, such as hallucinations and outdated information, by providing them with access to up-to-date and domain-specific data.

The RAG process typically involves two main steps: retrieval and generation. In the retrieval phase, the system searches a vector database for documents or chunks of text that are relevant to the user's query. These databases store document embeddings, which are numerical representations of the text's semantic meaning.

Once the relevant information is retrieved, it is passed to the generative phase. The LLM then uses this retrieved context, along with the original user prompt, to generate a comprehensive and accurate response. This essentially grounds the LLM's output in factual data, making it more reliable for enterprise applications, customer support, and research tasks.

To optimize a RAG system, careful consideration must be given to document chunking strategies, embedding models, and vector search algorithms. Proper chunking ensures that the retrieved context is concise and relevant, while a high-quality embedding model accurately captures the nuances of the text.
