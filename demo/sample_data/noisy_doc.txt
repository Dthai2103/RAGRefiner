<h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>
<p>
AI is like totally cool. It can do lots of things nowadays. 
Machine learning is a part of it and it learns from stuff you give it. 
http://example.com has more info maybe?

<script>alert("hello")</script>

    Anyway, neural networks are also a thing they use. I'm not really sure how they work but they are complicated. 
    People say AI will change the world. 
    It's important to know about.
